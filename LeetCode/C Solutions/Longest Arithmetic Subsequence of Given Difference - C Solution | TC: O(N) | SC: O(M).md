# Approach:

1. The solution initializes a large array dp[], where dp[i] is used to store the maximum length of the longest subsequence ending at i. To accommodate negative numbers, an OFFSET is added to the elements of the arr[] to shift them to non-negative indices.

2. The program then iterates over the input array. For each element, it calculates a target which is the value of the current element minus the given difference. This target value is the value of the previous element in the subsequence.

3. If the target is within valid bounds and exists in the dp[] array (i.e., a subsequence ending at target has been found before), then the program updates dp[i] to be one more than dp[target] as it extends the subsequence ending at target by one.

4. If the target is not within valid bounds or doesn't exist in dp[] array, then dp[i] is set to 1 as the current element forms a subsequence of length 1.

5. In each iteration, the program also updates maxLen, which is the length of the longest subsequence found so far.

6. Finally, the program returns maxLen which is the length of the longest subsequence with a given difference.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(M) 


# Code
```c
int longestSubsequence(int* arr, int arrSize, int diff) {
    int OFFSET = 1e5; // OFFSET to handle negative values
    int MAX_VAL = 2e5 + 5; // Maximum possible value after adding OFFSET

    int maxLen = 1;
    int dp[MAX_VAL]; // Array to store maximum sequence length ending at each element

    // Initialize dp array to 0
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VAL; i++) {
        dp[i] = 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < arrSize; i++) {
        int shiftedVal = arr[i] + OFFSET; // Shift value to make it positive
        int target = shiftedVal - diff;

        // Boundary check for target
        if (target >= 0 && target < MAX_VAL) {
            // Update dp value based on previous element's dp value
            dp[shiftedVal] = dp[target] + 1;
        } else {
            // If no valid target is found, set dp value to 1
            dp[shiftedVal] = 1;
        }

        // Update maxLen
        if (dp[shiftedVal] > maxLen) {
            maxLen = dp[shiftedVal];
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
}

```
